### Skeleton

I used Balsamiq to make the wireframes for this project. The website was designed to have 6 pages - Home, Login, Register, New Review, Manage Books and Manage Categories. The webiste also includes a logout link which logs out signed in users and takes them to the home page.
The wireframes were created for all pages for phone, tablet and desktop devices.

#### Wireframes Comments

Please note there are a few changes to the final site since the wireframes were made:

  * Change 1
  * Change 2

### Surface

#### Colours
I tok inspiration from [Waterstones](https://www.waterstones.com/) and [World of Books](https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb) to get the colour theme of green/blue. [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) also helped me find complemantary colours to go with the main green/blue colour. I used a teal (#xxxxxx), red (#xxxxxx) and yellow (#xxxxxx) for the majority of the site. For the navbar and headings text I picked xxxxxx and other text uses xxxxxx.

#### Imagery
I picked images of books and people reading books, I also wanted to pick images that created a sense of relaxation and calm (so a few of the images are of people reading outside). The images used on the site are credited in the credits - media section of this readme.

### User Authentication

### View Reviews

### Add New Review

### Update Current Review

### Delete Review

### Manage Books

### Manage Genres

### Online Validation

* I checked the website loads and responds as expected on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge browsers. 

* Used chrome developer tools and [responsinator](https://www.responsinator.com/) to check responsiveness on mobile, tablet and laptop devices.  
I also checked the website on my HP 15 inch laptop, Philips 20 inch monitor and Sony smartphone.

* Used the [w3c validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate my html (for both pages of the website) to check for no errors or warnings. 
* Used the [jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) to validate my style.css file to check for no errors or warnings. 
I did not validate css of the whole website as this included the imported bootstrap files.

* Used [Jshint](https://jshint.com/) to validate my js files and ensure no warnings or errors.

* Used [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/) to validate my python files and ensure no warnings or errors.

### Lighthouse Validation

I used [lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) in chrome developer tools to check the websites performance in terms of 
performance, accessibility, best practises and SEO.
This was done for both pages of the website and for both mobile and desktop devices.
The summary table below shows these metrics.

| Device | Page |  Performance | Accessibility  | Best Practises  | SEO |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mobile  |  Home | xx% | xx% | xx% | xx% |
| Mobile  |  Login | xx% | xx% | xx% | xx% |
| Mobile  |  Register | xx% | xx% | xx% | xx% |
| Mobile  |  New Review | xx% | xx% | xx% | xx% |
| Mobile  |  Manage Books | xx% | xx% | xx% | xx% |
| Mobile  |  Manage Genres | xx% | xx% | xx% | xx% |
| Desktop  |  Home | xx% | xx% | xx% | xx% |
| Desktop  |  Login | xx% | xx% | xx% | xx% |
| Desktop  |  Register | xx% | xx% | xx% | xx% |
| Desktop  |  New Review | xx% | xx% | xx% | xx% |
| Desktop  |  Manage Books | xx% | xx% | xx% | xx% |

## Deployment

### Creation

* All code was written in Gitpod and used [this template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) from Code Institute.
* Files were added to the staging area using "git add ."
* Files were committed to the local repository using "git commit -m 'commit message here'".
* Committed changes were pushed to the GitHub repository.

### GitHub Pages

To deploy the project to a live website the below steps were followed:

* Add in steps here for Heroku deployment.

### Local Clone
To make a local copy of a repository on your own GitHub account you can clone it.
This allows others to view the original code and/or make changes to it (on their own local copy).
Changing the code on your local repository will not affect the original code or deployed website.

To clone a repository in GitHub you can follow the steps below:
* Log into GitHub and locate the repository you wish to clone.
* Click on the code button (to the left of the green Gitpod button) and copy the https URL given.
* Open Gitpod (or another editor if you prefer).
* Use the "git clone 'insert copied URL here'" command.
* A clone of the original repository will now be available for you locally 
on your own repository to view/edit as you wish.

### Forking

Forking is another way to  make a local copy of a repository on your own GitHub account to do this follow the below steps:

* Log into GitHub and locate the repository you wish to fork.
* At the top-right of the repository (and top-right of the green Gitpod button), locate the fork button.
* A copy of the original repository will now be available for you locally 
on your own repository to view/edit as you wish.

## Credits

### Code

* The bootstrap library was used to help make this website responsive for different devices. 

* The bootstrap/Materializecss libraries were also used to help make x, y, z.   

### Content

* I used images from online, information below in the media section.

* For the general layout of the site I had a look at popular sites [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/) and [Waterstones](https://www.waterstones.com/) to see the layout of how reviews are displayed and get inspiration for style/colour themes. These sites also helped me make up fictional reviews for a range of books to be displayed on the site.

### Media

* I found the following image online from [blah](): 
  * image-x - owner xxxxx [image link here]()
